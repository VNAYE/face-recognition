  <h1>Face Recognition Attendance System</h1>

  <p>This project is a <strong>real-time face recognition-based attendance system</strong> that uses a live camera feed to automatically mark attendance. It's designed to help automate and digitize attendance tracking in schools, colleges, or offices using face detection and recognition.</p>

  <h2>🔧 Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong> – Programming language used to build the system.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenCV</strong> – A library used for image and video processing (face detection, recognition).</li>
    <li><strong>Streamlit</strong> – A Python library used to create interactive web applications easily.</li>
    <li><strong>Pandas</strong> – A library for working with structured data (CSV files in this project).</li>
    <li><strong>LBPH</strong> – Local Binary Pattern Histogram Face Recognizer (for identifying faces).</li>
    <li><strong>Pickle</strong> – Used for saving and loading Python objects like dictionaries (for names).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>👨‍🎓 Step-by-Step Explanation</h2>

  <h3>1. Student Registration (app.py)</h3>
  <p>In the <strong>"Register Student"</strong> section:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The user enters the student's name and roll number.</li>
    <li>The system then uses the camera to capture multiple images of the student's face.</li>
    <li>The images are saved in the <code>TrainingImage/</code> folder.</li>
    <li>These images are later used for training the recognition model.</li>
    <li>The student’s details are saved in <code>students.csv</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Image Capture (takeimages.py)</h3>
  <p>This script opens the webcam and captures grayscale images of the student’s face using OpenCV. Each image is saved with a unique filename that includes the student’s name and roll number.</p>

  <h3>3. Model Training (train.py)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reads all captured images from <code>TrainingImage/</code>.</li>
    <li>Uses OpenCV's LBPH face recognizer to train a model.</li>
    <li>Saves the trained model as <code>trainner.yml</code>.</li>
    <li>Stores a dictionary of <code>{Id: Name}</code> using pickle to a file called <code>names.pkl</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>LBPH</strong> is a fast and effective algorithm that compares local pixel patterns in faces. It works well even in different lighting conditions.</p>

  <h3>4. Face Recognition and Attendance (test.py)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Opens the webcam and starts detecting faces in real-time.</li>
    <li>For each detected face, it tries to recognize who it is using the trained model.</li>
    <li>If recognized (confidence &lt; 50), it marks the attendance using the <code>mark_attendance()</code> function.</li>
    <li>If not recognized, it shows a message: "You're not registered".</li>
    <li>Attendance is saved in <code>attendance.csv</code> with name, roll number, date, and present status.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Viewing Records (app.py)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Using Streamlit's interface, you can view both <strong>students.csv</strong> and <strong>attendance.csv</strong>.</li>
    <li>Duplicates are removed using Pandas.</li>
    <li>It displays this data in a readable table format on the webpage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 What is LBPH Face Recognizer?</h2>
  <p><strong>LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)</strong> is an algorithm used for facial recognition:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It converts each pixel to a binary value by comparing it to its surrounding neighbors.</li>
    <li>This binary pattern is then used to create a histogram.</li>
    <li>These histograms are compared to known faces to recognize a person.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📁 CSV Files</h2>
  <p><strong>students.csv:</strong> Contains registered student information.</p>
  <pre>
Name,RollNumber
John,101
Anita,102
  </pre>

  <p><strong>attendance.csv:</strong> Keeps attendance records marked through face recognition.</p>
  <pre>
Name,RollNumber,Date,Present
John,101,2025-05-15,Yes
